# 🍌 Banana Split Studio: Team Guide

## 🚀 What is this tool?
**Banana Split Studio** is our custom AI-powered storyboarding engine. It allows us to turn raw scripts into consistent, high-quality visual shots in minutes rather than days.

Unlike generic image generators, this tool is designed for **production consistency**. It "locks" onto our specific characters and art styles, ensuring that *Babaru* looks like *Babaru* in every single frame.

## 🔑 Core Concepts

### 1. The Rigs (Sidebar)
Before generating shots, we configure the "brain" of the AI:
*   **👥 Cast Roster**: Upload a reference image of our characters. The AI analyzes their physical traits (DNA) so it stays on-model.
*   **🎨 Style Configuration**:
    *   **Draft Style**: Upload a rough sketch (e.g., blue pencil) to define how our planning sketches look.
    *   **Final Style**: Upload a finished render (e.g., Pixar 3D, Anime, Watercolor) to define the final production look.

### 2. The Modes
*   **🖊️ Draft**: Generates loose layout drawings. Great for checking composition and blocking without wasting time on details.
*   **🎬 Final**: Generates high-fidelity, polished images that respect the *exact* composition of your sketch or draft.

## ⚡ Workflow: From Script to Screen

### Step 1: Prep
Open the Sidebar.
1.  **Add Cast**: Upload images for the characters in this scene.
2.  **Set Style**: Upload a style reference for the "Final" render.

### Step 2: Direct
1.  Paste your scene script into the **Script Editor**.
2.  Click **"Chunk Script"**.
    *   *The app will automatically break the script into a list of individual shots.*

### Step 3: Generate
Scroll through the Shot List. For each shot:
1.  **Select Cast**: Check off which characters are in this specific frame.
2.  **Sketch**: Click **Draft** to see a rough idea.
3.  **Render**: Click **Final** to turn that sketch into authorized production art.

### Step 4: Iterate (Free Render)
Need to fix a specific detail?
1.  Go to the **"🎨 Free Render / Revise"** tab.
2.  Upload your own rough drawing (or a corrected draft).
3.  Describe the scene and click **Render**. The AI will "paint over" your sketch using our locked visual style.

## 💾 Saving & Data
*   **Auto-Save**: The app saves every action automatically. You can refresh the page without losing work.
*   **Reset**: Use the "**⚙️ Manage Data**" menu in the sidebar to clear the cast or script when starting a new project.
